Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Savvy functional programmers are discovering logic programming, and SWI-Prolog's vast niftiness. Come watch Annie run her debugger in reverse, directly execute syntax specifications, and lets the computer figure out it's own darn execution strategy. Be amazed as Annie constrains variables and shrinks her APIs. Ooh and Aah at the many libraries, nifty web framework and clean environment.


40-minute conference session

Topics: Emerging Languages

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Most programmers encounter Prolog in a programming languages survey course, where the emphasis is on toy logic puzzles. Unfortunately, this introduction perpetuates a stereotype of Prolog as a special purpose inference engine rather than what it is, a powerful general purpose programming language well adapted to agile programming.

SWI-Prolog is a solid, reliable programming environment used in many mission critical high volume applications. This talk will concentrate first on concrete advantages of logic languages, and then on features of SWI-Prolog that would make it a great programming environment even if not for the
logic programming advantage.

Annie will demonstrate many of SWI-Prolog’s nifty features, including parsing as fundamental operation, constraint programming, and the metanifty web framework.
