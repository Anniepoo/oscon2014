Welcome to SWI-Prolog for the Real World.

Feel free to ask questions
Prolog experience (hi-lo hands)
* Language Intro

Prolog is the most widely used logic language.
Unknown outside academia, but influences everything
No reason for this, it's a great language for real world use.
I've written everything from web applications to mobile games to shell scripts with it.
* Logic Programming

Show family tree.
Define facts and rules.
Ask queries about them.
Solves for proofs of your query.
Prolog can be viewed as both procedural and declarative.
Imperative languages top bottom.
Prolog works by substituting the right hand side of rules for the query repeatedly until it finds true.
If it fails it backs up.
Awkward until you get it, then really neat.
* Directly execute syntax specifications
^t=3
^p=30
Here’s a backus-naur format syntax for a URL.
You’re looking at executable code. Definite Clause Grammars are a fundamental operation in the system.
Simply by passing the root of the syntax to phrase, I can see if it’s part of the language – that is, if it’s a well formed URL. 
I also have a negative test, which is says is false.
I can pass arguments so I can use semantics.
* Debugger retry
^t=1
^p=15
Prolog is stateless if you avoid assert and retract
You can step over things in the debugger, confident that you can retry them if you get an oops
* Constraints
^t=3
^p=50
Prolog’s a logic language. Variables are either bound, meaning we know their value, or unbound, meaning we don’t.  
Humans can say other things, like ‘I know this must be more than zero’.  
I can do same in Prolog.

This is really powerful. You can do many of the things you'd do with object getter/setters better this way
It also makes solving complex problems like figuring out train schedules trivial.
